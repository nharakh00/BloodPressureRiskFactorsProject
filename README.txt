Uncontrolled high blood pressure can lead to complications, including Heart attack or stroke. The project seeks to determine the effects of various risk factors on high blood pressure. 

Using this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mamta1999/cardiovascular-risk-data, we will determine the effects of various risk factors on blood pressure.  

There were three phases to this project:
1) Data Cleaning with SQL 
2) Data Exploration with SQL 
3) Tableau Dashboard 

This data shows that the biggest contributors to high blood pressure are age, cholesterol, and diabetes.
