 ## Motivation 

High blood pressure can lead to disability, poor quality of life, and even death. Some symptoms of high blood pressure are headaches, shortness of breath, and palpitations. As this affects many individuals, data regarding blood pressure and associated risks should be collected and analyzed regularly. 

## Questions and Stakeholders:
The stakeholders for this project are health policymakers who work for the federal government. They want to know the effects of various risk factors on high blood pressure.
The risks that will be studied in this project are:

1) Cigarette usage 
2) BMI levels
3) Cholesterol
4) Aging
5) Gender
6) Education levels

This knowledge will aid them in forming new policies to lower the amount of people with high blood pressure.
